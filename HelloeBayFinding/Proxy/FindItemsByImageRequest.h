 Aspect filters refine (limit) the number of items returned by a find

 <br><br>
 By issuing a series of find queries, you can continually refine the
 items returned in your responses. Do this by repeating a query using
 the aspect values returned in one response as the input values to
 your next query.
 <br><br>
 For example, the aspectHistogramContainer in a response on Men's
 Shoes could contain an aspect of Size, along with "aspect values" for
 the different sizes currently available in Men's Shoes. By populating
 aspectFilter fields with the values returned in an
 aspectHistogramContainer, you can refine the item results returned by
 your new query.

 <strong>Note:</strong> If a call that specifies an 
 <strong>outputSelector</strong> value of

 <strong>aspectHistogramContainer.domainName</strong>, this is a sign 
 that aspect histogram data might not be returned if you also specify an 
 <strong>aspectFilter</strong> in the next call. To ensure that 
 aspect histogram data is returned for the next call, add a <strong>
 domainFilter</strong> to the call as well.
