 AdFormat
 </dt>
 <dd>
 Advertisement to solicit inquiries on listings such as real estate.
 Permits no bidding on that item, service, or property. To express
 interest, a buyer fills out a contact form that eBay forwards to the
 seller as a lead. This format does not enable buyers and sellers to
 transact online through eBay and eBay Feedback is not available for
 ad format listings.
 </dd>
 <dt>
 Auction
 </dt>
 <dd>
 Competitive-bid online auction format. Buyers engage in competitive
 bidding, although Buy It Now may be offered as long as no valid bids
 have been placed. Online auctions are listed on eBay.com; they can
 also be listed in a seller's eBay Store if the seller is a Store
 owner.
 </dd>
 <dt>
 AuctionWithBIN
 </dt>
 <dd>
 Same as Auction format, but Buy It Now is enabled. AuctionWithBIN
 changes to Auction if a valid bid has been placed on the item. Valid
 bids include bids that are equal to or above any specified reserve
 price.
 </dd>
 <dt>
 Classified
 </dt>
 <dd>
 Classified Ads connect buyers and sellers, who then complete the sale
 outside of eBay. This format does not enable buyers and sellers to
 transact online through eBay and eBay Feedback is not available for
 these listing types.
 </dd>
 <dt>
 FixedPrice
 </dt>
 <dd>
 A fixed-price listing. Auction-style bidding is not allowed. On some
 sites, this auction format is also known as "Buy It Now Only" (not to
 be confused with the Buy It Now option available with competitive-
 bidding auctions). Fixed-price listings appear on eBay.com; they can
 also be listed in a seller's eBay Store if the seller is a Store
 owner.
 </dd>
 <dt>
 StoreInventory
 </dt>
 <dd>
 A fixed-price format for eBay Store sellers. Store Inventory listings
 appear after other listings in regular browse and search item
 listings on eBay. Store items have a lower Insertion Fee and longer
 listing durations. This selling type can only be specified by sellers
 who have an eBay Store. Store Inventory listings are listed on
 eBay.com as well as in the seller's eBay Store.
