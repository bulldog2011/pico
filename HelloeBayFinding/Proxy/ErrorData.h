/**
 
 Indicates whether the reported problem is fatal (an error) or is less-
 severe (a warning). Review the error message details for information on
 the cause.
 <br><br>
 If the request fails and the application is the source of the error (for
 example, a required element is missing), update the application before
 you retry the request. If the problem is due to incorrect user data,
 alert the end-user to the problem and provide the means for them to
 correct the data. Once the problem in the application or data is
 resolved, re-send the request to eBay.
 <br><br>
 If the source of the problem is on eBay's side, you can retry the request
 a reasonable number of times (eBay recommends you try the request twice).
 If the error persists, contact Developer Technical Support. Once the
 problem has been resolved, you can resend the request in its original
 form.
 <br><br>
 If a warning occurs, warning information is returned in addition to the
 business data. Normally, you do not need to resend the request (as the
 original request was successful). However, depending on the cause of the
 warning, you might need to contact the end user, or eBay, to effect a
 long term solution to the problem.
