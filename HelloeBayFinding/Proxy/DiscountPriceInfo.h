 This container supplies information for an item that has a Strike-Through
 Pricing (STP) or Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) discount pricing treatment.
 STP and MAP applies to only fixed price, BIN items. STP is available on the
 US, UK, and DE sites while MAP is available only on the US site.

 This feature is available to qualified sellers who participate in the
 Discount Pricing program. A seller can provide a discount price treatment for
 Non-MSKU and MSKU items in Clothing, Shoes and Accessories (CDA), Motors, and
 Electronics (Home and Garden is expected to be supported in the future).
