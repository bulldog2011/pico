/**
 
 Request container for the findCompletedItems call.
 <br><br>
 You can expect response times for this call to be longer than other types of Finding Service
 requests. The call must search through historical databases rather than performing a quick
 lookup on currently listed items. There is a 5,000 limit on the number of findCompletedItems
 calls an application can make in a single day (even if the application has completed an
 app check).
 <br><br>
 Be aware that it is possible to use this call in such a way as to violate the terms and
 conditions of your API License Agreement. Ensure that you do not store the results retrieved
 from this call or use the results for market research purposes.

/**
 
 Specify one or more words to use in a search query for finding items
 on eBay. By default, queries search item titles only. When running
 queries, it is best to include complete keywords values--eBay checks
 words in context with each other. If you are using a URL request and
 your keyword query consists of multiple words, use "%20" to separate
 the words. For example, use "Harry%20Potter" to search for items
 containing those words in any order. Queries aren't case-sensitive,
 so it doesn't matter whether you use uppercase or lowercase letters.
 <br><br>
 You can incorporate wildcards in a multi-word search. For example,
 "ap*%20ip*" returns results for "apple ipod" among other matches. The
 words "and" and "or" are treated like any other word (and not their
 logical connotation). Only use "and", "or", or "the" if you are
 searching for listings containing those specific words.
 <br><br>
 findCompletedItems requires that you specify either keywords or a
 categoryId in the search criteria.

 If a specified category ID doesn't match an existing category for the

 valid categories, use the Shopping API <b

/**
 
 Aspect filters refine (limit) the number of items returned by a find
 request. Obtain input values for aspectFilter fields from an
 aspectHistogramContainer returned in the response of a previous
 query.
 <br><br>
 By issuing a series of find queries, you can continually refine the
 items returned in your responses. Do this by repeating a query using
 the aspect values returned in one response as the input values to
 your next query.
 <br><br>
 For example, the aspectHistogramContainer in a response on Men's
 Shoes could contain an aspect of Size, along with "aspect values" for
 the different sizes currently available in Men's Shoes. By populating
 aspectFilter fields with the values returned in an
 aspectHistogramContainer, you can hone the item results returned by
 your new query.
 <br/><br/>
 <span class="tablenote">
 <strong>Note:</strong> If a call that specifies an 
 <strong>outputSelector</strong> value of 
 <strong>AspectHistogram</strong> returns 
 <strong>aspectHistogramContainer.domainName</strong>, this is a sign 
 that aspect histogram data might not be returned if you also specify an 
 <strong>aspectFilter</strong> in the next call. To ensure that 
 aspect histogram data is returned for the next call, add a <strong>
 domainFilter</strong> to the call as well.

 Defines what data to return, in addition to the default set of data,
 in a response.
 <br><br>
 If you don't specify this field, eBay returns a default set of item
 fields. Use outputSelector to include more information in the
 response. The additional data is grouped into discrete nodes. You can
 specify multiple nodes by including this field multiple times, as
 needed, in the request.
 <br><br>
 If you specify this field, the additional fields returned can affect
 the call's response time (performance), including in the case with
 feedback data.

 Reference ID, specify productID.type= ReferenceID and set
 productID.value to an ePID value (also known as an Bay Product
 Reference ID). If you do not know the ePID value for a product, use
 FindProducts in the eBay Shopping API to retrieve the desired ePID:
