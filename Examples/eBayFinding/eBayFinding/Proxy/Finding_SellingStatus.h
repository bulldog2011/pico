 The current price of the item given in the currency of the site on which
 the item is listed. That is, currentPrice is returned in the original
 listing currency.

 For competitive-bid item listings, currentPrice is the current minimum
 bid price if the listing has no bids, or the current high bid if the
 listing has bids. A Buy It Now price has no effect on currentPrice.
 <br><br>
 For Basic Fixed-Price (FixedPrice), Store Inventory (StoreInventory), Ad
 Format (AdFormat), and Classified Ad (Classified) listings, currentPrice
 is the current fixed price.
