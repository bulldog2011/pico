 There are three categories of error: request errors, application errors,
 and system errors. Request and application errors are often caused by
 passing invalid data in the request. System errors are primarily caused by
 application failures and cannot be corrected by changing request values.

 Indicates that an error has occurred on the eBay system side. For
 example, a database or server could be down. Inspect the error message to
 find the cause of the problem. If the problem is on the eBay side, an
 application can retry the request as-is a reasonable number of times
 (eBay recommends twice). If the error persists, contact Developer
 Technical Support. Once the problem has been resolved, the request may be
 resent in its original form.

/**
 
 An error occurred due to a problem with the request, with the most likely
 source being the application sending the request. For example, the
 request is missing a required data element or it contains an invalid
 field. The problem must be corrected before the request can be resent.
 Inspect the error message to find the cause of the problem. If the
 problem is due to an application error, modify the application and resend
 the request. If the error is due to invalid data, the source of the data
 must be corrected before you resend the resend request to eBay.

/**
 
 An error occurred due to a problem with the request, with the most likely
 source being missing or invalid data in the request. The problem must be
 corrected before the request can be retried. Inspect the error message to
 find the cause of the problem. If the problem is a result of end-user
 data, alert the end-user to the problem and provide the means for them to
 correct the problem. Once the problem is resolved, resend the request to
 eBay.
