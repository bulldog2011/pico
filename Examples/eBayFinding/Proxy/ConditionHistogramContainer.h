/**
 
 Statistical (item count) information on the condition of items
 that match the search criteria (or specified category).
 For example, the number of brand new items that match the query.
 <br>
 <br>
 Each conditionHistogram specifies one condition and the
 number of matching items found. The list of all
 conditionHistogram containers returned represents the union of
 all conditions that were found in the item results.
 For example, if items were found in different categories,
 and if those categories support different sets of
 item conditions, then all those conditions are
 returned in the list, regardless of category.<br>
 <br>
 If multiple items use the same condition ID, but some items
 use different display names for that condition, the histogram
 shows the site's default display name for that condition.
 This means that the condition name in a histogram may not
 always exactly match the condition names on the counted items.
