/**
 
 An error has occurred either as a result of a problem in the sending application or because 
 the application's end-user has attempted to submit invalid data (or missing data). 
 In these cases, do not retry the request. The problem must be corrected before the request 
 can be made again. If the problem is due to something in the application (such as a missing 
 required field), the application must be changed. If the problem is a result of end-user data, 
 the application must alert the end-user to the problem and provide the means for the end-user 
 to correct the data. Once the problem in the application or data is resolved, resend the request to eBay
 with the corrected data.

 Indicates that an error has occurred on the eBay system side, such as a database or server down.

 If the error persists, contact Developer Technical Support. Once the problem has been resolved, 
 the request may be resent in its original form.
