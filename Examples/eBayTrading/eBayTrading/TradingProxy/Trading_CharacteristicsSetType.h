 characteristic that is common to all items within the specified characteristic
 set. In the context of GetProductSearchPage, each characteristic identifies a
 single searchable attribute. A searchable attribute is a product aspect or
 feature that can be used as a criterion in a search for catalog content. For
 example, "Title" might be a criterion for searching the book catalog for Pre-
 filled Item Information related to books. See the eBay Web Services guide for
 more information.
