 then Color may still have a high confidence score

/**

 Item Specific, if any.

 <br>
 For example, in a clothing category, Size Type could be 
 recommended as a parent of Size, because Size=XL would 
 mean something different to buyers when 
 Size Type=Juniors or Size Type=Regular. <br>
 <br>
 Or in the US (in the future), a list of cities can vary depending
 on the state, so State could be recommended as a parent of City.<br>
 <br>
 Currently, categories only recommend a maximum of one parent 
 for an Item Specific.
 For example, Size=XL could have a Size Type=Juniors
 parent in a Juniors clothing category. 
 In the future, some categories may recommend multiple parents.
 For example, City=Mountain View could have parents like 
 State=California, State=New York, and State=North Carolina.<br>
 <br>
 If an Item Specific has value dependencies (i.e., if it has value recommendations that contain Relationship), then
 all of its value recommendations are returned (regardless of the 
 number you specified in MaxValuesPerName).
