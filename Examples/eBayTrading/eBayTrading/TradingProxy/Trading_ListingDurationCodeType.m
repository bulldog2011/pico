 This enumerated type contains the list of values that can be used by the seller to set
 the duration (number of days or Good 'Til Cancelled) of a listing. 
 <br><br>
 Listing durations available to the seller may vary based on the site, category, listing 
 type, and the seller's selling profile, so it is a best practice for the seller to call 
 <b>GetCategoryFeatures</b> with <b>ListingDurations</b> 
 included as a <b>FeatureID</b> value in the call request. The 
 <b>GetCategoryFeatures</b> response will include the complete list 
 of listing duration values that can be used for the various listing types.

 This value is used to set the duration of the listing to one day. A one-day listing 
 duration is typically only available to sellers with a Feedback score of 10 or 
 higher, so sellers with a Feedback score of less than 10 may be restricted from

 <b>GetCategoryFeatures</b> with <b>ListingDurations</b> 
 included as a <b>FeatureID</b> value in the call request to see if the 
 one-day listing duration is available.

 A one-day listing duration is generally applicable to an auction listing or to a 
 Real Estate Classified Ad.
