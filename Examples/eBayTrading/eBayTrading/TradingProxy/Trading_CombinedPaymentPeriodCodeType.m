 This enumerated type contains the list of values that can be used by the seller to set
 the number of days after item purchase that an unpaid order can be combined with one 
 or more other mutual (same buyer and same seller) unpaid orders into one "Combined 
 Payment" order. Either the buyer or the seller can initiate the Combined Payment 
 process. Sellers can offer buyers shipping discounts through Combined Payment orders, 
 and buyers only have to make one payment for multiple orders as oppposed to a payment 
 for each order.
