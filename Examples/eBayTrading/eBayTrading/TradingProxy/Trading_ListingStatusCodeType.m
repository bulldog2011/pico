/**
 @file
 
 Specifies an active or ended listing's status in eBay's processing
 workflow. If a listing ends with a sale (or sales), eBay needs to
 update the sale details (e.g., total price and buyer/high bidder)
 and the final value fee. This processing can take several minutes.
 If you retrieve a sold item and no details about the buyer/high
 bidder are returned or no final value fee is available, use this
 listing status information to determine whether eBay has finished
 processing the listing.

 The listing is still active or the listing has ended with
 a sale but eBay has not completed processing the sale details

 considered active until all items have winning bids or
 purchases or the listing ends with at least one winning bid or
 purchase. If the listing has ended with a sale but this Active
 status is returned, please allow several minutes for eBay to
 finish processing the listing.
