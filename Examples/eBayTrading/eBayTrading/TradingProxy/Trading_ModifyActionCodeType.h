 This enumerated type defines the values that can be used when adding, modiying, or 
 deleting a shipping discount profile (through the <b>ModifyActionCode</b> 
 field in <b>SetShippingDiscountProfiles</b>), or when adding, modiying, or 
 deleting a promotional sale (through the <b>Action</b> 
 field in <b>SetPromotionalSale</b>), or when adding or removing one or more
 listings from the promotional sale (through the <b>Action</b>
 field in <b>SetPromotionalSaleListings</b>). 
 <br/><br/>
 For <b>SetPromotionalSaleListings</b>, the specified action ('Add' or 
 'Delete') will apply to all listings specified in the <b>PromotionalSaleItemIDArray</b> 
 container. A promotional sale can also be applied to all listings of a specified 
 category (using <b>CategoryID</b> in the 
 <b>SetPromotionalSaleListings</b> request). However, an entire category 
 of listings cannot be removed from a promotional sale. In other words, the 
 <b>Action </b> field cannot be set to 'Delete' if a 
 <b>CategoryID</b> is specified.
