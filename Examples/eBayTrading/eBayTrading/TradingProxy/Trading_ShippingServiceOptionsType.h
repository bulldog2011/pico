/**
 
 The meaning of this element depends on the call and on whether flat or
 calculated shipping has been selected. (For example, it could be the
 cost to ship a single item, the cost to ship all items, or the cost to ship
 just the first of many items, with ShippingServiceAdditionalCost accounting
 for the rest.) When returned by <strong>GetItemShipping</strong>, it includes the packaging and
 handling cost. For flat and calculated shipping.
 <br>
 <br>
 If a shipping service has been specified (even LocalPickup), GetItem returns
 the shipping service cost, even if the cost is zero. Otherwise, cost is not
 returned.
 <br>
 <br>
 If this is for calculated shipping for a listing that has not
 yet ended, note that the cost cannot be determined until the listing
 has ended and the buyer has specified a postal code.
 <br>
 <br>
 For <strong>GetItemShipping</strong>, promotional shipping savings is reflected in the cost, if
 applicable. If the promotional shipping option is lower than other shipping
 services being offered, the savings is reflected in the returned shipping
 cost.
 The shipping service named Promotional Shipping Service (or whatever is
 the localized name for it) is included among the shipping services.
 If the promotional shipping cost is lower than the cost of other shipping
 services being offered, it is presented first in the list. (The LOWEST shipping
 service cost is always presented first, regardless of whether there is
 promotional shipping.)

    For <strong>GetMyeBaySelling</strong>, ShippingServiceCost under the SoldList and DeletedFromSoldList containers returns the cost of the  domestic leg of a Global Shipping Program shipment (to the international shipping provider's warehouse).
