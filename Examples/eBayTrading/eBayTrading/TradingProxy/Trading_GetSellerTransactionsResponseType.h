/**
 
 Returns an array of order line item (transaction) data for the seller specified in the request.
 The results can be used to create a report of data that is commonly
 necessary for order processing.
 Zero, one, or many <b>Transaction</b> objects can be returned in the <b>TransactionArray</b>.
 The set of order line items returned is limited to those that were modified between
 the times specified in the request's <b>ModTimeFrom</b> and <b>ModTimeTo</b> filters.
 The order line items returned are sorted by <b>Transaction.Status.LastTimeModified</b>,
 ascending order (that is, order line items that more recently were modified are returned last).
 Also returns information about the seller whose order line items were requested.
 If pagination filters were specified in the request, returns meta-data describing
 the effects of those filters on the current response and the estimated effects if
 the same filters are used in subsequent calls.
