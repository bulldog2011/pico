 The VAT (Value-Added Tax) rate for the order line item. When the <b>VATPercent</b> is specified, the
 item's VAT information appears on the item's listing page. In
 addition, the seller can choose to print an invoice that
 includes the item's net price, VAT percent, VAT amount, and
 total price. Since VAT rates vary
 depending on the item and on the user's country of residence, a
 seller is responsible for entering the correct VAT rate; it is
 not calculated by eBay. To specify a <b>VATPercent</b>, a seller must
 have a VAT-ID registered with eBay and must be listing the item on a
 VAT-enabled site. Max applicable length is 6 characters,
 including the decimal (e.g., 12.345). The scale is 3 decimal places.
 (If you pass in 12.3456, eBay may round up the value to 12.346.)
 Note: The View Item page may display the precision to 2 decimal places
 with no trailing zeros. However, the full value you send in is stored.
