 All other item fields are optional, even if listed as required for other calls.
 However, as some tips are dependent on the properties of the item, and as some properties
 have dependencies on other properties, we strongly recommend that you include all the item properties
 that will be included in the AddItem, ReviseItem, or RelistItem request.
 When the Listing Analyzer engine is run, tips will only be returned for fields that are specfied on the item.<br>

 When the Product Pricing engine is run, pricing data will be based on the catalog product you specify.
