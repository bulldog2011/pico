/**
 
 Detail levels are instructions that define standard subsets of
 data to return for particular data components (e.g., each
 Item, Transaction, or User) within the response payload.
 For example, a particular detail level might cause the
 response to include buyer-related data in every result
 (e.g., for every Item), but no seller-related data.
 Specifying a detail level is like using a
 predefined attribute list in the SELECT clause of an SQL query.
 Use the DetailLevel element to specify the required detail level
 that the client application needs pertaining to the data components
 that are applicable to the request.<br>
 <br>
 The DetailLevelCodeType defines the
 global list of available detail levels for all request types.
 Most request types support certain detail
 levels or none at all. If you pass a detail level that exists
 in the schema but that isn't valid for a particular request,
 eBay ignores it processes the request without it.
 For each request type, see the detail level tables in the
 Input/Output Reference to determine which detail levels are
 applicable and which elements are returned for each applicable
 detail level. (Some detail level tables are still in the
 eBay Web Services guide. They will be moved to the
 Input/Output Reference in a future release.)<br>
 <br>Note that DetailLevel is required input for
 GetMyMessages. <br>
 <br>
 With GetSellerList and other calls that retrieve large data sets,
 please avoid using ReturnAll when possible. For example, if you use
 GetSellerList, use a GranularityLevel or use the
 GetSellerEvents call instead. If you do use ReturnAll with
 GetSellerList, use a small EntriesPerPage value and a short
 EndTimeFrom/EndTimeTo range for better performance.

 Most Trading API calls support a <b>MessageID</b> element in the request

 <b>MessageID</b> in a request, the same value will be returned in the 
 <b>CorrelationID</b> field in the response. Pairing these values can 
 help you track and confirm that a response is returned for every request and to
 match specific responses to specific requests.
 If you do not pass a <b>MessageID</b> value in the request, 
 <b>CorrelationID</b> is not returned.<br>

 <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
 <b>GetCategories</b> is designed to retrieve very large sets of metadata
 that change once a day or less often. To improve performance, these calls return
 cached responses when you request all available data (with no filters). When this
 occurs, the <b>MessageID</b> and <b>CorrelationID</b> fields
 aren't applicable. However, if you specify an input filter to reduce the amount of
 data returned, the calls retrieve the latest data (not cached). When this occurs,
 <b>MessageID</b> and <b>CorrelationID</b> are applicable.

 You need to use a version that is greater than or equal to the

 informational warning that the value in the HTTP header was used
 instead.)

 You can use the OutputSelector field to restrict the data returned by this call.
 When you make a call such as GetItem that retrieves data from eBay,
 the OutputSelector field is useful for restricting the data returned.
 This field makes the call response easier to use, especially when a large payload
 would be returned. If you use the OutputSelector field, the output data
 will include only the fields you specified in the request.
 For example, if you are using GetItem and you want the item data
 in the response to be restricted to the ViewItemURL
 (the URL where a user can view the listing) and BuyItNowPrice, then
 within the GetItem request, specify those output fields.
 To use this field, see the information at the following link.

 An unrecognized element is one that is not defined in any supported

 so using WarningLevel can also help you remove any potential hidden
 bugs within your application due to incorrect case or spelling in
 field names before you put your application into the
 Production environment.<br>

 WarningLevel only validates elements; it doesn't validate
 XML attributes. It also doesn't control warnings related to
 user-entered strings or numbers, or warnings for
 logical errors.<br>

 We recommend that you only use this during development and debugging.
 Do not use this in requests in your production code.
