/**
  
 For the US, Canada and Australia sites, users registered after January 17,2007 are 
 required to offer at least one safe payment method (i.e. PayPal/PaisaPay, or one 
 of the credit cards specified in Item.PaymentMethods).
 <br>
 If a seller has a 'SafePaymentExempt' status, they are exempt from the category 
 requirement to offer at least one safe payment method when listing an item on a 
 site that has the safe payment requirement.
 <br>
 The safe payment requirement also applies to two-category listings that have one 
 ship-to or available-to location in the US, Canada, or Australia. The French 
 Canadian (CAFR) site is a special case, because listings on the CAFR site with 
 ship-to or available-to locations in Canada do not require a Safe Payment method, 
 yet listings on the CAFR site with ship-to or available-to locations in the US or 
 Australia do require a safe payment method.
 <br>
 The Business and Industrial, Motors, Real Estate, and Mature Audiences categories, 
 and all listings that don't support Item.PaymentMethods are exempt from this 
 requirement. Therefore, listings in those categories do not require a safe payment 
 method.
 <br>
 Currently, this field contains no other special meta-data.(An empty element is 
 returned.)
 <br> 
 Use SiteDefaults.SafePaymentRequired and Category.SafePaymentRequired to determine 
 which categories require a safe payment method.
