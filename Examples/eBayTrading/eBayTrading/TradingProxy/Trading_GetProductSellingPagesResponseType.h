/**
 
 
 A string containing a list of all the attributes that are applicable
 to the products specified in the request, along with related meta-data.
 The meta-data specifies the pre-filled values of each attribute, the
 possible values of attributes that are not pre-filled, the logic for presenting
 the attributes to a user, and rules for validating the user's selections.
 <br><br>
 For backward compatibility, this data is in
 the same XML format that was used in the Legacy XML API so that you can
 apply the same Item Specifics XSL stylesheet to it. That is, individual
 elements are not described using the unified schema format.
 <br><br>
 The data is based on the GetAttributesCS response (AttributeData), with
 additional information that is specific to catalog products.
 Product and attribute information is nested within a set of Product tags.
 The product-specific data is merged into the attribute data so that the same
 XSL stylesheet used to render the results of GetAttributeCS can be used to render
 catalog product data. See GetAttributesXSL.
 <br><br>
 See the Attribute Meta-Data Model section of the eBay Web Services guide
 for information about each element in the ProductSellingPagesData string.
 <br><br>
 Because the content is returned as a string, the XML markup elements are escaped with
 character entity references (e.g.,&amp;lt;eBay&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Attributes&amp;gt;...).
 See the appendices in the eBay Web Services guide for general information about
 string data types.
