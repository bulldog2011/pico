 In order for a buyer to make a full payment on an US or CA motor vehicle, at least one of

 <li>CashInPerson</li>
 <li>LoanCheck</li>

/**
 
 This dollar value indicates the amount of the deposit that a buyer must make on a purchased
 motor vehicle (eBay Motors US and CA). The deposit amount can be as high as $2,000.00. If not
 specified, this value defaults to '0.0'. If the seller is requiring that the buyer put down 
 a deposit on the vehicle, the seller must include and set the <b>DepositType</b> 
 field to 'OtherMethod' and specify an HoursToDeposit value.
 If specified, then also specify <b>HoursToDeposit</b> 
 <br>
 <br>
 Deposits can only be paid using PayPal, so if <b>DepositAmount</b> is 
 specified (and not '0.0'), then the listing must offer
 'PayPal' as a payment method (in addition to the payment methods
 offered for the full payment). Unlike other listings, PayPal is not 
 automatically added to a Motors listing even if the seller has a 
 PayPal preference set in My eBay. The seller also needs to have a 
 linked PayPal account in order to require a deposit.<br>
 <br>
 The deposit amount appears in the shipping, payment details and return policy section of the 
 View Item page.<br>
 <br>
 <b>For ReviseItem and related calls</b>: If the listing
 has no bids, the seller can add or lower a deposit; and they can 
 increase the deposit if the listing doesn't require Immediate Payment.
 The seller can also remove the Immediate Payment option (if any).
 If the listing has bids, the seller can only lower an existing 
 deposit; but not add or increase a deposit. The seller can't remove 
 Immediate Payment when a listing with a deposit has bids.
