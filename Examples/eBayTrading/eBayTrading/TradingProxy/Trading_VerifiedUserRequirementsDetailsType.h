 For eBay sites that support Verified User Requirements, this boolean is always

 the <b>VerifiedUser</b> field in that container should only be passed 
 into the request if the seller is only willing to sell items to Verified Users. If 
 the <b>VerifiedUser</b> field is omitted from the listing call, the 
 specified <b>FeedbackScore</b> value will only apply to unverified users.

 Currently, this feature is only supported by the following sites: UK, Australia, 
 France, Spain, India, Ireland, Malaysia, Philippines, and Singapore. However, this 
 is subject to change, so it is always a good idea for the seller to call 
 <b>GeteBayDetails</b> with <b>DetailName</b> set to 
 <b>BuyerRequirementDetails</b>.
