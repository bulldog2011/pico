 This integer value indicates the maximum quantity of items that a single buyer may

 quantity of items that will exceed this value. Previous purchases made by the buyer
 are taken into account. For example, if <b>MaximumQuantity</b> is set to
 '5' for an item listing, and <em>Buyer1</em> purchases a quantity of
 three, <em>Buyer1</em> is only allowed to purchase an additional 
 quantity of two in subsequent orders on the same item listing.
