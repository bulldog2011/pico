 However, the words in the name must be an exact match (or a subset
 consisting of complete words) to the words in the product title in
 the catalog. The words in the name are matched using OR logic
 (the order of the words does not matter). As with all strings, you
 need to escape reserved characters such as ampersand.
 See the eBay Trading API Guide for more information about how
 to specify this value.

 The validation rules are the same as the rules for the event name.
 In addition, eBay supports both US English and UK English spelling

 "theatre"). As with all strings, you need to escape reserved

 In most cases, you should be able to specify any numeric date format

 d or dd for the day, and yy or yyyy for the year, in all
