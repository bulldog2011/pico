                   In an international shipping rate table, sellers can specify an alternative shipping rate for each shipping service category, for each country in a given base region. The international rate table has nine base regions: Africa, Asia, Central America and Caribbean, Europe, Middle East, North America, Oceania, Southeast Asia, and South America.
 
          You can use the GetUser call to determine if the seller has configured a shipping rate table. If the domestic shipping rate table is available for this seller, the <strong>User.SellerInfo.DomesticRateTable</strong> field will be <code>true</code>. If the international shipping rate table is available for this seller, the <strong>User.SellerInfo.InternationalTable</strong> field will be <code>true</code>.

    <strong>Note:</strong> You can use <strong>RateTableDetails</strong> to apply a shipping rate table to a listing or remove it from a listing. However, the details of a shipping rate table configuration can only be viewed and modified on the eBay website, not by using the API.
    </span>
 
    Sellers use a dropdown list to specify the alternative shipping rate applied by the rate table as one of the following:
    <ul>
    <li>A flat amount per item </li>
    <li>A flat surcharge (domestic rate tables only) </li>
    <li>A surcharge by weight </li>
    </ul>
 
                   This selection applies to the entire table; there is no mixing and matching by region or shipping category.
    <br><br>
 
                   If you are applying a shipping rate table that specifies a surcharge by weight, you must specify the item weight in the <strong>ShippingDetails.CalculatedShippingRate</strong> container's <strong>WeightMajor</strong> and <strong>WeightMinor</strong> fields, even though this is a flat rate listing. Do not use any other fields in the <strong>CalculatedShippingRate</strong> container because those are not supported in this scenario.

                   <span class="tablenote">
    <strong>Note:</strong> There is currently no way to determine through the API whether a seller's rate table specifies a surcharge by weight, so your application must make it clear to the seller that item weight must be supplied if the seller has specified a surcharge by weight. If the required weight values are not supplied, a default weight of one unit (1 lb or 1 kg, depending on locale) is used as the basis for the surcharge.
    </span>
 
    This container is returned from the GetItem family of calls only for the seller who listed the item.
