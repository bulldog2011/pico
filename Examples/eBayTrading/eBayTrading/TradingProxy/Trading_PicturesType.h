/**
 
 A container consisting of one or more picture URLs associated with a variation
 specific value (e.g., color=blue). For example, suppose a listing contains blue
 and black color variations, and <b>VariationSpecificName= Color</b>.
 In this case, one picture set could contain pictures of the blue shirts (e.g.,
 front view, back view, and close-up of a trim detail), and another picture set
 could contain pictures of the black shirts.
 <br><br>
 A variation specific picture set can consist of up to 12 images hosted by eBay
 Picture Services (EPS). However, only one picture may be used if that picture is
 hosted outside of eBay. eBay Picture Services and self-hosted images can never
 be combined into the same variation specific picture set.
 <br><br>
 At least one picture set is required if the <b>Pictures</b> node 
 is present in the request. You are not required to provide pictures 
 for all values that correspond to the variation specific name. 
 For example, a listing could have pictures depicting the blue and 
 black color variations, but not the pink variations.
