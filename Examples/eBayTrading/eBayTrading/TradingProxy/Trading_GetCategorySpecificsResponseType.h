/**
 
 Returned with request version 609 and higher. <br>
 <br>
 Contains the most popular Item Specifics, if any, for a category
 specified in the request, or contains information about whether
 the recommendations have changed for that category since
 the LastUpdateTime you requested. <br>
 <br>
 The most relevant Item Specifics (as determined by eBay) 
 are returned first. In many cases, the values are returned in 
 alphabetical order.<br>
 <br>
 This node returns empty (or it's not returned) for a category if
 there is no applicable data (such as when you request a parent category, a category that has no popular Item Specifics yet,
 or a duplicate category that was already returned).
 If you pass in the CategoryID and Name fields together, but no
 matching values are found for the name, eBay returns the name
 with no values (even if the name is not recommended).<br>
 <br>
 If GetCategoryFeatures indicates that custom Item Specifics are
 enabled for a leaf category, but GetCategorySpecifics doesn't
 return any recommendations for that category, the seller can still
 specify their own custom Item Specifics in that category.
