  This field indicates the type and amount of the refund to the buyer involved in

  attribute indicates whether the refund is being applied against the purchase price or  
  the shipping price. Using the <strong>issueRefund</strong> call of the 
  Order Adjustment API, the seller can also issue an optional/additional refund that 
  does not apply to the purchase price or shipping price.
  The <strong>type</strong> values are defined in the 
  <strong>RefundLineTypeCodeType</strong> enumeration type.<br/><br/>
  <br/><br/>
  <strong>RefundLine</strong> fields will only be returned if a refund 
  has been issued from the seller to the buyer for a DE/AT order going through the new
  eBay payment process.
