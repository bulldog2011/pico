 After this change is made, GetItem only shows the new name in VariationSpecfiics.<br>

 Note that variations that were sold while they used the old name will also be changed to use the new name in eBay's system. (This may change in the future.)<br>

 If you are making other changes to a variation (such as adding new 
 values or pictures), use consistent names to avoid unexpected 
 results. For example, specify the same new name to identify the 
 variation specific in VariationSpecifics and Pictures, (in addition to adding the new name here in ModifyNameList).
